# Callback handler

An utility to deal with **callback functions** and avoid **callback "hell"**.

You can run several functions in **parallel** or in **sequence** (even **mixing both types**) and receive a single result object with results for every call.

In sequential statements, you can access results from immediately previous function, creating cascading calls (**waterfall**).

You can get the result in a **Promise** (using async/await) or providing a **single callback function** that receives the `Result` object with results for every call.

<br />

## Example

Creating a log file from the content of several files using `node:fs` (callbacks). The order in which every file is appended to log is not important, so we can parallelize it.

The code will:
- delete current log file (if exists) with `fs.rm()`
- execute (in parallel) for every file
  - read content with `fs.readFile()`, then (sequentially)
  - write content retrieved from previous function to log file with `fs.appendFile()`

> [!NOTE]
> All code excerpts will be provided in TypeScript. To use it in plain JavaScript, just ignore all types declaration (the **`: type`** part of the code).

```ts
/**
 * Creates a log file from several files
 */

import { CB } from "callback-handler";


const logFile: string = path.resolve(__dirname, "mainLog.log"),
      file1:   string = path.resolve(__dirname, "file1.log"),
      file2:   string = path.resolve(__dirname, "file2.log"),
      file3:   string = path.resolve(__dirname, "file3.log"),
      file4:   string = path.resolve(__dirname, "file4.log");


// Create execution structure 
const structCB = 
    CB.s ( // 🠄 sequential structure as root

        // Delete current log file
        CB.f ( fs.rm, logFile, {force: true}), // 🠄 Creates a function structure using CB.f()


        // Create log from several files
        CB.p ( // 🠄 parallel structure, since the order in which every file is written in
               //    log is not important (can be parallelized)

            CB.s ( // 🠄 sequential structure
                CB.f ( fs.readFile, file1, {encoding: 'utf-8'} ),      // 🠄 read content 
                CB.f ( fs.appendFile, strLogFile, CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1) // 🠄 write results from 
                                                                       //    previous call to log file
            ),

            // The same (in parallel) for every file ...
            CB.s (
                CB.f ( fs.readFile, file2, {encoding: 'utf-8'} ),
                CB.f ( fs.appendFile, logFile, CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1)
            ),
            CB.s (
                CB.f ( fs.readFile, file3, {encoding: 'utf-8'} ),
                CB.f ( fs.appendFile, logFile, CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1)
            ),
            CB.s (
                CB.f ( fs.readFile, file4, {encoding: 'utf-8'} ),
                CB.f ( fs.appendFile, logFile, CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1)
            )
        )
    );


// Execute and retrieve results using Promise (async/await)
const objResult = await CB.e (structCB);


// Check results
if (objResult.timeout || objResult.error)
    console.log("Something went wrong while creating the log");
else
    console.log("Log created");
```




## Installation and usage
To install, run this command in your terminal:

`npm install @mcatani/callback-handler`

Load it in your code as ECMAScript (esm) or CommonJS (cjs) module.
```ts
// esm
import { CB } from "@mcatani/callback-handler";
```
```ts
// cjs
const { CB } = require("@mcatani/callback-handler");
```
> [!TIP]
> It can be used in JavaScript or TypeScript codes (no need for additional types).





## The execution structure
The execution structure stores information about what functions to run (including arguments) and when (execution order).

It is composed of three different structures:





### Function structure (`FunctionStruct`)

Stores info about what function to execute and the arguments to be used, except for the callback (which is always the last argument).

It is created through `CB.p()` function, which has two overloaded signatures:

```ts
// Without alias
CB.f ( fn: Function,    // 🠄 function to be executed
       ...args: any[]); // 🠄 arguments to be passed to function
```
```ts
// With alias
CB.f ( alias: string,   // 🠄 alias for this call, to facilitate results retrieval
       fn: Function,    // 🠄 function to be executed
       ...args: any[]); // 🠄 arguments to be passed to function
```

Example using `fs.writeFile()` to write some text in UTF-8 enconding to a file: 

```typescript
// Mind:
// - don't include parenthesis after function name
// - don't include the callback parameter
CB.f (fs.writeFile, PathToFile, TextToWrite, "utf-8")
```



### Parallel structure (`ParallelStruct`)

Stores info about sub structures to be executed in parallel. Every sub structure can be:
- a **Function Structure** (`FunctionStruct`), 
- a **Sequential Structure** (`SequentialStruct`),
- or even another **Parallel Structure** (`ParallelStruct`).

It is created through `CB.p()` function, which has two overloaded signatures:

```ts
// Without alias
CB.p ( ...subStructs: FunctionStruct | ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct);
```
```ts
// With alias
CB.p ( alias: string,
      ...subStructs: FunctionStruct | ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct);
```

Example using `fs.writeFile()` to write text in UTF-8 enconding to 3 files in parallel: 

```typescript
CB. p (
    CB.f (fs.writeFile, PathToFile1, TextToWrite1, "utf-8"),
    CB.f (fs.writeFile, PathToFile2, TextToWrite2, "utf-8"),
    CB.f (fs.writeFile, PathToFile3, TextToWrite3, "utf-8")
);
```



### Sequential structure

Stores info about sub structures to be executed in sequence (execution only starts after the previous one finishes). Every sub structure can be:
- a **Function Structure** (`FunctionStruct`), 
- a **Parallel Structure** (`ParallelStruct`),
- or even another **Sequential Structure** (`SequentialStruct`).

It is created through `CB.s()` function, which has two overloaded signatures:

```ts
// Without alias
CB.s ( ...subStructs: FunctionStruct | ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct)
```
```ts
// With alias
CB.s ( alias: string,
      ...subStructs: FunctionStruct | ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct)
```
Results from the immediately previous call can be used as arguments in a **Function Structure**

Example using `fs.readFile()` and `fs.appendFile()` to read text from a file and then append it to another file: 

```typescript
CB.s (
    CB.f ( fs.readFile, PathToFileFrom, {encoding: 'utf-8'} ),
    CB.f ( fs.appendFile, PathToFileTo, CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1)
)
```

#### Accessing previous results

To use previous results, pass one of the following tokens as arguments to your function:

| Token | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_ERROR`   | Value of the first argument (**which is the error**) passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT1` | Value of the *first argument* **after the error** (i.e. the second argument) passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT2` | Value of the *second argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT3` | Value of the *third argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT4` | Value of the *fourth argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT5` | Value of the *fifth argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT6` | Value of the *sixth argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT7` | Value of the *seventh argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT8` | Value of the *eighth argument* after the error passed to callback function |
| `CB.PREVIOUS_RESULT9` | Value of the *ninth argument* after the error passed to callback function |

> [!WARNING]
> If you try to use a token in the very first function of a sequential structure, an exception will be thrown, since there is no previous result.

> [!WARNING]
> If you try to use a token in a parallel structure, an exception will be thrown.




### Anatomy of execution structure

Execution structure is a tree where:
- all leaves are **Function Structures**,
- all nodes are **Parallel Structures** or **Sequential Structures**,
- root is a **Parallel Structure** or **Sequential Structure**.

An example:

```ts
Parallel            🠄 root
┣━ Function         🠄 leaf
┣━ Sequential       🠄 node
┃  ┣━ Function      🠄 leaf
┃  ┣━ Function      🠄 leaf
┃  ┗━ Parallel      🠄 node
┃     ┣━ Function   🠄 leaf
┃     ┗━ Function   🠄 leaf 
┗━ Paralell         🠄 node
   ┣━ Function      🠄 leaf
   ┗━ Function      🠄 leaf
```




## Executing functions

Use the function `CB.e()` to execute a previously created execution structure and get the results.

You can do that using **async/await** (Promise) or providing a **callback function**.




#### Callback function

To use the callback approach, provide a function as last argument to execution function
```ts
CB.e (execStruct, callback);
```

The callback function must have the signature:
```ts
function(error:   boolean |,   // 🠄 true, if an error was returned from any function,
                  CBException  //    or CBException, if any exception was thrown during execution
         timeout: boolean,     // 🠄 true if ellapsed execution time exceeds defined timeout
         result:  Result);     // 🠄 Result object
```
<br/>

#### Async/await

To use async/await approach, just ignore the callback argument of execution function 
```ts
const result = await CB.e (structure);
```
<br/>
<br/>


#### Anatomy of execution function (`CB.e()`)
The execution function has several overloads
```ts
    // For await/async approach
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct): Promise<Result>;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number): Promise<Result>;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               breakOnError:  boolean): Promise<Result>;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               breakOnError:  boolean,
               stats:         boolean): Promise<Result>;


    // For callback approach
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               callback:      TCallback): void;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               callback:      TCallback): void;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               callback:      TCallback): void;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               breakOnError:  boolean,
               callback:      TCallback): void;
    function e(execStruct:    ParallelStruct | SequentialStruct, 
               timeout:       number,
               breakOnError:  boolean,
               stats:         boolean,
               callback:      TCallback): void
``` 

| Argument     | Description | Default value |
| ----------   | ----------- | ----------- |
| execStruct   | Execution structure (`ParallelStruct` or `SequentialStruct`) to be executed            |       |
| timeout      | Maximum time (in milliseconds) for the execution to complete                           | 5000  |
| breakOnError | Defines if execution must be stopped at first error returned from a function structure | false |
| stats        | Defines if the execution time ellapsed must be gathered)                               | false |
| callback     | Callback function to retrieve results (only for callback approach)                     |       |

Examples:
```ts
// Using await/async
const result: Result = await CB.e (executionStructure); // 🠄 Execute with default values:
                                                        //        timeout      = 5000
                                                        //        breakOnError = true
                                                        //        stats        = false

const result: Result = await CB.e (executionStructure,  // 🠄 Execution structure:
                                   2000,                // 🠄 2 seconds for timeout
                                   false,               // 🠄 Don't stop execution if error is returned
                                   true);               // 🠄 Gather stats info




// Using callback
CB.e (executionStructure,           // 🠄 Execution structure
      (error, timeout, result) =>   // 🠄 Callback function
      {
          if (error || timeout)
              console.log("Something wrong");
          else
              // do stuff ...

      });

CB.e (executionStructure,           // 🠄 Execution structure
      3500,                         // 🠄 3.5 seconds for timeout
      true,                         // 🠄 Stop execution if any error is returned
      true,                         // 🠄 Gather stats info
      (error, timeout, result) =>   // 🠄 Callback function
      {
          if (error || timeout)
              console.log("Something wrong");
          else
              // do stuff ...

      });

```

## Getting results

## Checking errors

## Exceptions
All exceptions and errors will be instances of `CBException` class, which has the properties:

| Property | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| details   | This will be set when the exception comes from a function execution or when a function execution returns an error in callback. It will have a `callIndex` value and may have a `callAlias` value (if provided).|
| explanation | A brief text with clues as to what might have gone wrong |
